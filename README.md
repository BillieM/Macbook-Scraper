# Macbook-Scraper
A quick web scraper with push notifications created to get a good deal on a macbook

**
This project was put together in just over an hour.

I used cron to schedule the script to run every 5 minutes on my raspberry pi, it ultimately ended up getting me a good deal on a 2016 macbook pro, which i managed to buy within minutes of the listing being created.
